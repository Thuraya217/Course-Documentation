Comparison of compiler and interpreter:

Programming Language: formal system of notation used to write computer programs. It allows programmers to communicate instructions to a computer in a way that the machine can understand and execute. 

Components of a Programming Language:
Syntax: The set of rules that define the correct structure of a program. 
Semantics: The meaning of the instructions. 
Compiler/Interpreter: Converts code into machine-understandable format.

Comparison of compiler and interpreter:
   A-Compiler:
      -is a translator that takes input
      -The compiler saves the Machine Language in form of Machine Code on disks. 
      -Compiled codes run faster than Interpreter.
      -The compiler generates an output in the form of (.exe).
      -Errors are displayed in Compiler after Compiling together at the current time.
      -It does not require source code for later execution
      -C, C++, C#, etc are programming languages that are compiler-based



   B-Interpreter:
      -program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language
      -The Interpreter does not save the Machine Language.
      -Interpreted codes run slower than Compiler
      -The interpreter does not generate any output
      -Errors are displayed in every single line.
      -It requires source code for later execution
      -Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc are programming languages that are interpreter-based
