Programming Paradigms :method to solve problem or to do some task by useing programming language

A- imperative programming paradigm: it is step by step task. it focus on how to achieve the goal.

    - procedural programming: step by step program. that devided programs in to procedures. from operate top to down. focusing on sequence of instruction that operate on data.  
    - object oriented programming: is encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). and follow some principles for example (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction). and you can reusability and modularity.
    - parallel processing approach: it is type of computation where do multiple processes at the same time to improve performance and efficient.



B- Declarative programming paradigm: it is building programs. it is foucses on what the outcome. 

    - logic programming paradigm: a program have set of rouls and facts and involves querying to have conclusions.  Such as Prolog
    - functional programming: it is mathematical function that avoid changing the state and date. Such as Haskel
    - database processing approach: it use to store the data. Such as SQL
