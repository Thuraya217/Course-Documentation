Algorithm  Components:

   -Variables: is any attribute, characteristic, number, or quantity that can change or take on different values in different situations. 

   -Input and Output statements: Read data from input devices, Send data to output devices

   -Conditional Statements (Decision Making): allow programs to make decisions based on conditions

   -Loops (Iteration): repeat code multiple times (while loop, for loop)

   -Functions (Procedures): reusable of code
   
   -Arrays and Lists: store multiple values of the same type
