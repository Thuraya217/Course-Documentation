B- Agile and Scrum

1- explain the agile methodology of working and its purposes
agile methodology:flexible project management, which ia methodology based on creativity, responding to changes and adapting quickly to them. it is also complete methodology for 
project management based on the short term planning process through short development phases to achieve conyiunous improvement of the product or service.
also, continuing to improve the project throughout its life cycle in order to implement it with the highest guality and in the fastest time, and targeting the cooperation of the work 
team to solve the problems they may encounter while working on the project.

- purposes:
a- work flexible
b- take shot time
c- reduced risk
d- improved quality


2- compare between agile and waterfall models : advantage, disadvantage, when to use it, best practice of both
A- agile models:
advantage: 
-work flexible
-take shot time
-can handle changes tee requirements along the way

disadvantage:
-allows for additional feature requests which may add cost or time
-project management holds little authority
-requires costomer involvement 

when to use it: 
-if we have a short time to finish project 
-complex deliverables
-frequent iterations and refinements

B- waterfall models: 
advantage: 
-use utilizes an clear, structured approach
-support all planning to be completed
-easy to trank progress

disadvantage:
-not flexible
-take long time and long delivery time line
-challenging to see the value of completed tasks throughout the project if only released at the end

when to use it: 
-if we want to complete all tasks before issuing any work and we cannot move between each task before completing the task before it.
-simple score and requirement gathering
-clear and linear sequence of tasks and structured processes
 
(best practice of both: is agile)


3- state all the frameworks that you know are used for implementing agile
-Scrum
-Lean Software Development (LSD)
-Dynamic Systems Development Method (DDSM)
-eXtreme Programming (XP)



4- explain in detail the scrum framework for agile : timing, meetings, roles
Scrum: it is in agile methodology is an iterative and incremental framework that helps teams deliver high-quality products in a timely manner. scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences,
self organize while working an a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

-First, the product owner meets with the client. To take the requirements the requirements include:( Ranked list of what is required, features, stories). Where it comes out with requirements called product Backlog.

-Then the product owner meets with the team implementing the project to give them instructions. The team selects requirement
items it commits to deliver by the end of the Sprint. This stage is called (sprint planning meeting)

-Then the team starts implementing the project according to the requirements and time specified for the first sprint.

-During this period, the team holds a daily scrum meeting to discuss progress. The meeting is held in the presence of (scrum master)

-After the completion of the first spring of the project, the meeting will be held between team and product owner. Discuss what has been completed. It is called (sprint review). 

-After that, a meeting is held to discuss the strengths and weaknesses that the team faced in the first part, in order to avoid them in other projects. It is called (sprint retrospective).
