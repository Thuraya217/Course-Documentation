1- State all the SDLC phases: explain each phase, its role in software development and its input & output?
To make a project we use different phases. Each stage has a specific use.
ClickSoftware Development Life Cycle


A- Analysis: The first stage of each project. It is used to collect requests. This stage includes planning the project tasks such as (cost, project requirements, time to finish project, .....). The development team collects information
from clients to create the project.

input: meet the client and take the requirements
output: list of requirements


2- Design: At this stage the system and software are designed based on the specification and requirements that were studied in the analysis stage. Contains (UX, UI)

input: list of requirements
output: design for requirements

3- Development: At this stage developers actually write the codes and requirements and create the application according to the requirements.

input: design for requirements
output: writing codes and designing the entire project

4- Testing: at this stage we test the program or project for problems and ensure that it is running properly. Also, it is important to ensure that the project contains all the required requirements.

input: writing codes and designing the entire project
output: test the program and make sure it works properly

5- Deployment: At this stage the project or program is published for use

input: test the program and make sure it works properly
output: publish the program

6- Maintenance: at this stage the site or program is maintained if any malfunction occurs after uploading.

input: publish the program
output: make sure the program is working properly




B- state all the roles / titles that you know in the SDLC, their responsibilities and tools that they used if any

1- Analysis:
-product owner: the employee responsible for ensuring that the final result of the product design is achieved.
-project manager specializes in planning, implementing and supervising IT project within the organization.

-CTO: he is a technical decision maker in the company, in addition to fixing all IT related problems, implementing, developing and managing resources, and has a very strong background in computer science and engineering.

2- 2- Design: 
-UX (user experience): where it means the movements that occur on the sits and the transitions
-UI (user interface): the way the user sees the site or interface
-System architect: the person who design the codes and databases

3- Development:
-Front-end developer: his task encloud designing the visual aspects of the sites that the user interacts with. such as (colors, page design, and fonts).
-Back-end developer: they create the invisible parts that help websites work properly.

4- Testing: 
-Solution Architect: helps ensure a new system fits the existing enterprise environment.
-QA Engineer (Quality assurance): it's a quality control or monitoring. its responsibilities include ensuring quality and ensuring that all work meets the required specifications.
-Tester: Hey, find errors and fix them, and test the software to discover any problem.
-DevOps: the tools that the organization uses to deliver applications and services at high speed.

5- Deployment: 
-Data Administrator: installs databases, monitors performance, manages security, migrates and patches data, and troubleshoots.
-DevOps: the tools that the organization uses to deliver applications and services at high speed.

6- Maintenance: 
users: people who use the program.
testers: those who fix any problem that occurs to the program after publishing.
support managers: support program management after publishing to program.
